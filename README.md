# Article full text FreshRSS extension
This is a FreshRSS extension that uses the Readability library to extract the full text of an article.
Most importantly, it does **not** require any docker containers or external services to work.

This is based on the [ttrss-af_readability](https://gitlab.tt-rss.org/tt-rss/plugins/ttrss-af-readability) plugin for Tiny Tiny RSS by Andrew Dolgov and the [xExtension-Readable](https://github.com/printfuck/xExtension-Readable) extension for FreshRSS by printfuck.

[Official documentation](https://freshrss.github.io/FreshRSS/en/developers/03_Backend/05_Extensions.html) on how to write extensions.
